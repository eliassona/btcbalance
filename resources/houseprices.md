### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) Calculation:

To re-evaluate, we calculate the CAGR for house prices in SEK, USD, and CHF from 2003 to 2024.

#### Housing Price CAGR:
- **SEK**: 
  \[ \text{CAGR}_{SEK} = \left( \frac{7,695,586}{2,500,000} \right)^{\frac{1}{21}} - 1 \approx 6.06\% \]

- **USD**:
  \[ \text{CAGR}_{USD} = \left( \frac{731,520}{339,674} \right)^{\frac{1}{21}} - 1 \approx 4.76\% \]

- **CHF**:
  \[ \text{CAGR}_{CHF} = \left( \frac{654,387}{432,526} \right)^{\frac{1}{21}} - 1 \approx 2.07\% \]

#### CAGR for Reference Assets:
- **Gold**:
  \[ \text{CAGR}_{\text{Gold}} = \left( \frac{315}{944} \right)^{\frac{1}{21}} - 1 \approx -5.1\% \]

- **Bitcoin**:
  \[ \text{CAGR}_{\text{BTC}} = \left( \frac{11}{4,216,950} \right)^{\frac{1}{14}} - 1 \approx -42.1\% \]

### Performance of Housing Prices Relative to Gold and Bitcoin:

Given that house prices in nominal terms have increased but decreased when measured against gold and Bitcoin, we need to understand the effective depreciation of SEK, USD, and CHF in terms of purchasing power.

#### Calculating Inflation Rates:

1. **SEK Inflation**:
   - **Relative to Gold**:
     \[ \text{Inflation}_{SEK} = \text{CAGR}_{SEK} - (-5.1\%) = 6.06\% + 5.1\% = 11.16\% \]
   - **Relative to Bitcoin**:
     \[ \text{Inflation}_{SEK} = \text{CAGR}_{SEK} - (-42.1\%) = 6.06\% + 42.1\% = 48.16\% \]
   - **Average Estimate**:
     \[ \text{Average Inflation}_{SEK} \approx 29.66\% \]

2. **USD Inflation**:
   - **Relative to Gold**:
     \[ \text{Inflation}_{USD} = \text{CAGR}_{USD} - (-5.1\%) = 4.76\% + 5.1\% = 9.86\% \]
   - **Relative to Bitcoin**:
     \[ \text{Inflation}_{USD} = \text{CAGR}_{USD} - (-42.1\%) = 4.76\% + 42.1\% = 46.86\% \]
   - **Average Estimate**:
     \[ \text{Average Inflation}_{USD} \approx 28.36\% \]

3. **CHF Inflation**:
   - **Relative to Gold**:
     \[ \text{Inflation}_{CHF} = \text{CAGR}_{CHF} - (-5.1\%) = 2.07\% + 5.1\% = 7.17\% \]
   - **Relative to Bitcoin**:
     \[ \text{Inflation}_{CHF} = \text{CAGR}_{CHF} - (-42.1\%) = 2.07\% + 42.1\% = 44.17\% \]
   - **Average Estimate**:
     \[ \text{Average Inflation}_{CHF} \approx 25.67\% \]

### Conclusions:

1. **House Prices vs. Hard Assets**:
   - Despite nominal increases in house prices, their real value, when adjusted against gold and Bitcoin, indicates a decrease. This suggests significant depreciation in purchasing power for SEK, USD, and CHF over the period.

2. **High Inflation in Currencies**:
   - The substantial average inflation rates derived from comparing house price growth with the depreciation of gold and Bitcoin highlight severe currency depreciation relative to these hard assets.
   - This is especially pronounced when using Bitcoin as a reference, reflecting Bitcoin's dramatic rise in value compared to fiat currencies.

3. **Currency Comparison**:
   - **SEK**: The highest implied inflation rate among the three currencies, indicating significant depreciation.
   - **USD**: Moderate implied inflation rate, reflecting noticeable but less severe depreciation.
   - **CHF**: The lowest implied inflation rate, aligning with Switzerland's strong currency stability reputation.

4. **Impact on Investment**:
   - **Housing Investment**: Nominal gains in SEK, USD, and CHF terms, but real value decreases when adjusted against hard assets.
   - **Gold and Bitcoin**: Using these as benchmarks shows stark contrasts, especially Bitcoin, which dramatically outpaces the performance of traditional currencies in terms of purchasing power retention.

This analysis underscores the importance of considering real, inflation-adjusted returns when evaluating long-term investments and the impact of currency depreciation over time.
